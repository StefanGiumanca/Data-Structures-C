This repository contains implementations of essential data structures in C, designed for learning, practice, and interview preparation. It includes:
	•	Array (dynamic array implementation with resizing support)
	•	Linked List (Singly)
	•	Doubly Linked List
	•	Stack (LIFO structure)
	•	Queue (FIFO structure)
	•	Hash Table (with basic collision handling)
 	•	Heap (includes both Min-Heap and Max-Heap implementations)
  •	Binary Search Tree (with insert, search, and traversal operations)
 	•	AVL Tree (self-balancing binary search tree with rotation logic)
	•	Graph (using adjacency list representation)
Each data structure is implemented from scratch and follows clean, object-oriented design principles.
